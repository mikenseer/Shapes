# Cells 

Cells fall from top of screen

Player can slide left&right to catch bad Cells and avoid good cells

Fills up cargo bay so player can destroy the bad cells.
  -Can only hold X number of cells, first in first out overflow while touch active
  -3x of same shape clears those 3.
  -Can shuffle posiitons of cells in cargo by tap+slide. (just like bejeweled)
  -Blood cells fill up cargo but are worth no points.  Only way to get rid of them is to overflow them out or use a Clear
  -Limited number of "Clears" to use per level.

Hitting White blood cells and certain other cells? reduces shields.

When new Cell falls from top, game pauses and message appears explaining that cell.  <-- Maybe too intrusive
First time cargo bay is full, game pauses to explain destroy button. <-- Maybe too intrusive

Each level has a certain "infection" level.  Scoring reduces infection level.  Once at 0, player completes level.
Infection may rise at a steady state in later levels.
Low med and high scores for each level.


Some levels focus on dodging, some on collecting, some both.
